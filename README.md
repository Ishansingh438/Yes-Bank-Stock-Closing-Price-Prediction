# Yes-Bank-Stock-Closing-Price-Prediction

Abstract:
Closing prices are useful markers for investors to use to assess
changes in stock prices over time. Even in the era of 24-hour trading,
there is a closing price for any stock, and it is the final price at which
it trades during regular market hours on any given day. The closing
price is considered the most accurate valuation of a stock or other
security until trading resumes on the next trading day. The closing
price on one day can be compared to the closing price on the previous
day, 30 days earlier or a year earlier, to measure the changes in
market sentiments toward that stock.
Our model will help to predict what could be the monthly stock’s
closing price.

Problem Statement:
The historical of five years data provided by the Yes bank monthly
stock’s closing price. We will explore, analyse the data to make the
best fit model using linear regression to accurately predict the future
stock’s closing price.

Data Summary:
• Date: The Month and Year of the time the prices were recorded
from 1st July 2005 to 1st November 2020.
• Open: Opening Stock price of the Month.
• Close: Closing Stock price of the Month.
• High: Highest stock price of the Month.
• Low: Lowes stock price of the Month.

Conclusion:
So finally we reached the end of our exercise. Starting with loading
the data so far we have done EDA and treatment with the null values,
Missing values and encoding of categorical columns feature selection
and model building.

• We have successfully built a predictive models that can predict the
stock closing price.
• Ridge regression model had the lowest RMSE.
• The proposed stock closing price predictor has been successfully
trained by using regression model on the sample of datasets and the
closing stock price prediction process has been successfully
performed by using Prophet model being tested on the test dataset.
